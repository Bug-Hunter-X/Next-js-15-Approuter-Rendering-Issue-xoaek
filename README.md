# Next.js 15 App Router Rendering Problem

This repository demonstrates a strange rendering issue encountered in a minimal Next.js 15 App Router application. The application compiles without errors, but the content fails to render in the browser. 

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Observe that the page renders a blank screen instead of displaying 'Next.js 15 App'.

## Potential Causes

The cause might be related to unexpected behavior or conflicts introduced in Next.js 15's App Router implementation, or some missing configuration or optimization that isn't obvious from a simple setup.

## Solution

The solution is provided in the `index.solution.js` file.  While the original minimal example failed to render, adding simple extra components or using a layout wrapper addresses the issue, suggesting a potential timing or hierarchy related problem in the rendering process.
